Goal: Build a single-page React application called "The Deal Margin Simulator." This is a financial calculator for solopreneurs to determine if a fixed-price sponsorship deal is actually profitable after taxes, expenses, and time are factored in.

Tech Stack:

React (Vite)

Tailwind CSS

Lucide React (Icons)

Important: Use npm run build compatible code (ES Modules).

Design System (Mandatory):

Aesthetic: "Clean FinTech." Minimalist, trustworthy, high whitespace.

Background: bg-slate-50 (Soft Gray). NEVER pure white or dark mode.

Cards: bg-white, rounded-xl, shadow-sm, border border-slate-200.

Primary Action Color: bg-blue-600 (Hover: bg-blue-700).

Text: Headers: text-slate-900, font-bold. Body: text-slate-600. Muted: text-slate-400.

Font: System Sans-Serif (Inter style).

Inputs: rounded-lg, border-slate-300, focus:ring-blue-500.

Core Logic (The Math):

Inputs (Card 1 - "The Deal"):

Deal Amount ($)

Estimated Hours (Filming, Editing, Admin)

Number of Revisions (Default: 0) -> Logic: Each revision adds 2 hours.

Expenses (Software, Contractors, Props) ($)

Tax Rate (%) (Default to 30%)

Input (Card 2 - "Your Standards"):

"Minimum Hourly Floor" (Slider or Input). Default: $100/hr.

Calculations:

Net Revenue = Deal Amount - Expenses - (Deal Amount * (Tax Rate/100))

Total Hours = Estimated Hours + (Revisions * 2)

Effective Hourly Rate = Net Revenue / Total Hours

The Result (Card 3):

Display the Effective Hourly Rate big and bold.

Conditional Logic:

IF Effective Rate >= Minimum Floor: Show GREEN Card. Text: "DEAL APPROVED."

IF Effective Rate < Minimum Floor: Show RED Card. Text: "REJECT DEAL" (or "Negotiate Higher").

Layout Structure:

Header: Simple logo/title top left ("Deal Margin Simulator").

Main Content: Centered single column (max-w-2xl).

Top Section: The Input Cards.

Bottom Sticky (or Fixed) Section: The Result Card (Update in real-time).

Footer: "Built by Playbook Media."

Specific Features:

Add a "Scenario Toggle" at the top: "Quick Check" vs "Deep Dive" (Deep dive reveals hidden fields like 'Software Subscription costs' or 'Agency Fees', but start with Quick Check visible).

The "Action" Button: In the Result Card, add a button that says "Lock in this deal with a contract" (Link placeholder: #).

Execution: Scaffold the app, creating the components for DealInputs, RateStandards, and ResultCard. Ensure the layout is mobile-responsive (stack columns on mobile).
